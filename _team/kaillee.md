Kaillee works as an Associate Editor on the Spanish Language Team for the Keywords Project; additionally, she works as a curatorial assistant at the Newcomb Art Museum and as an archival assistant and metadata specialist for the Stone Center for Latin American Studies. Kaillee’s PhD dissertation, entitled “When I Am Not Here, *Estoy Allá*: Visualizing Expansive Space-Time in Caribbean Diasporic Memory,’’ places the work of five prominent Caribbean diasporic artists–María Magdalena Campos-Pons, La Vaughn Belle, Firelei Báez, Alberta Whittle, and Deborah Jack–in direct conversation with each other, tracing a thread of multivalent memory keeping.
