is an essayist, a beadworker, a poet, an American historian, and the proud descendant of Louisiana Creoles who migrated to California. Her nonfiction writing delves into the themes of race and belonging, skin color and ancestry, colonialism and family narratives, migration, sexuality, oral history, and hybridity. While in residence, Gaudin worked on her original manuscript, “Creole: A Brief History of Louisiana People,” which is under contract with LSU Press. She also supplemented her writing with beadwork, which is connected with Creole culture and history.
