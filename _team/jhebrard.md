is a cultural historian who has written on topics as varied as literacy in southern Europe, the culture of self-educated people (autodidactes) in France, the writing of slavery in the notarial and sacramental records of Brazil, and, most recently, of slavery and freedom in the Atlantic world. Hébrard is currently co-director of the Centre de Recherche sur le Brésil contemporain at Paris’s École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales and Visiting Professor at Johns Hopkins University (Department of History). He is the co-author of Discours sur la Lecture, 1880-2000, which has gone through two editions in France and been translated into Spanish and Portuguese. He has published widely in many languages, in journals from the French Annales to the Polish Progranicza. An internationally recognized expert on education, Hébrard has served as advisor to Prime Minister Michel Rocard, special advisor to Minister of Education and Culture Jack Lang, and Inspector General for National Education. One of his recent books, Freedom Papers: An Atlantic Odyssey in the Age of Emancipation (with Rebecca J. Scott, Harvard University Press, 2012), was awarded the American Historical Association’s 2012 Alfred J. Beveridge Award and its 2012 James A. Rawley Prize.
