abstract: Letter from enslaver Sainsone of Martinique to his stepson Denis Braud "au
  Mississpy" in which he informs Braud that having learned of Mr Dussau's departure
  from Martinique to Braud's home just 8 hours before he left, he decided to send

  sent with Apollon as well as instructs Braud that he must pay for his passage and
