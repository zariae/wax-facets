“Kinship and Belonging: Reimagining the Place of Black Life in the Louisiana Colonial
Archive" recasts the story of Africans and people of African descent through the
experiences of enslaved and free people of color in colonial Louisiana. In 1719, the first
documented slave ships from West Africa arrived in Louisiana. In 1803, the United
States purchased the Louisiana Territory from France. In the century between, Black
and Black-Native people navigated the French and then Spanish colonial legal regimes
to secure their freedom and wrest back control over their futures as revealed in the
documents contained within this colonial archive. This struggle appears in an archive
fraught with imperial impositions, violences and dispossessions, silences and erasures.
Despite the fraught nature of the archive, the extant manuscript sources of colonial
Louisiana are a deep and rich resource for Black peoples’ political practices, resistance
to slavery and oppression, alliances across race and status, and strategies for securing
joy and forming community.
